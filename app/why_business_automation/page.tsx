          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What is Business Automation Using AI?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            Traditional business automation focuses on streamlining repetitive, rule-based tasks. Business Automation using AI takes this a giant leap further. It involves leveraging intelligent technologies – like machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and predictive analytics – to automate more complex, cognitive tasks that previously required human judgment and intervention.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            Instead of just following pre-programmed instructions, AI-powered automation systems can:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            <li><b>Learn from data:</b> Continuously improve their performance and adapt to new situations.</li>
            <li><b>Understand and process language:</b> Interact with customers, analyze documents, and extract insights from text.</li>
            <li><b>Recognize patterns and make predictions:</b> Forecast trends, identify opportunities, and anticipate potential issues.</li>
            <li><b>Make intelligent decisions:</b> Autonomously handle exceptions and complex scenarios.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            Essentially, AI empowers businesses to automate not just the "doing" but also the "thinking" and "learning" aspects of various processes.
